Planned upgrade: Face Anti-Spoofing
The system will be expanded to detect and prevent forms of face spoofing, such as:
- Still image attacks (printing photos, holding them in front of webcam)
- Video attacks (opening videos on phones/laptops to fool the camera)
  
Objectives:
- Ensuring that the recognized face is a real face, present in front of the camera
- Preventing logins or identity authentication using fake images/videos
  
Tentatively applied techniques:
- Using CNN models to distinguish real and fake images
